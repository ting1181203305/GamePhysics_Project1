Introduction
Just as the title of the game, this developed game was briefly about the dog, which his name was "Doge", that lost their way in the deep forest somewhere in Japan. During Doge's randomly finding its way back to the shelter, he encountered a gray wolf. Doge thought to himself, "Hmm, wolf usually comes in packs. How did this one come from?". Upon further investigation, the wolf seems to be starving and was hunting around to satisfy the hunger. Doge thinks that he should escape the scene, it stepped onto the sticks by accident. The noise echoed the whole forest. Without thinking twice, Doge dashs to escape the scene as fast as possible and thought to itself, "Welp, time to rush. Beep beep~!". Doge could confims that the dashing sound definitely came from behind and was getting nearer by seconds. Now, let's witness how the story of Doge unfolds and was it possible to get home safe and soundly.
